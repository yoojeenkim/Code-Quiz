# Code Quiz Homework #4

## Overview
As a coding student, I wanted to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals in which I will be docked points of the timer if I get a question wrong. The final score will be saved to gauge my progress along with my initials.

## Key Functions

```
When user clicks the start button, a timer starts along with the presentation of the first question.

When the user answers a question, it will slide to the next question along with if it was correct or incorrect.

If incorrect, time will be deducted from the timer.

When all questions are answered, the game will end.

The user will be directed to enter their initials and their score will be saved upon hitting the submit button.
```


## Demonstration
![A user clicks through an interactive coding quiz, after which the user will enter their initals and grab the score/timer. This will log their score into the high scores page and they can reset the high scores if desired and/or go back to the start of the quiz.](./assets/images/screencast-www.google.com-2021.09.22-23_16_45.gif)
